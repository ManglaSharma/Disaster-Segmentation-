# Flood Segmentation Project ðŸŒŠ

This project focuses on detecting and segmenting flooded regions from satellite or aerial images using deep learning. It uses a **U-Net-based model with a ResNet encoder** for accurate segmentation of flooded and non-flooded areas.

### Features:
- Preprocessing and augmentation of dataset
- U-Net model with pretrained backbone
- Evaluation metrics: Dice Score, IoU
- Model training, validation, and testing scripts
- Prediction and visualization of segmentation results
- Option to deploy a web dashboard for interactive predictions

### Tech Stack:
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **segmentation-models-pytorch**
- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib**
